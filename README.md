The goal is to create a RSVP-style art speedreader, scraping images from the Google Art and Culture databases, and presenting them serially, while scaled to make them easy to read. 

# Components
- Image scraper to download images to /tmp file
- Compile and view images
- Command-line interface to permit custom search term 

# Tech Stack
- Python Backend

# Anticipated challenges:
- loading times, this was challenging last time to show lead and show each image without an unusable delay
-- Option: preload a compiled gif?
-- Other loading options?
